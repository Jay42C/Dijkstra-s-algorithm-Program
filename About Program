This Program will implement Dijkstra's algorithm in order to determine the cheapest fights from San Francisco to other cities for a fictitious airline, CS Airlines. I will use the following map of available flights on CS Airlines. Each vertex has a name and an index, e.g. SFO has index 0, LAX has vertex 1, etc. Each edge has a weight which is the cost of a ticket between the two cities.I designed and implemented a C++ class to represent this graph using an adjacency matrix. In addition to storing the adjacency matrix, the class will include a method which uses Dijkstra's algorithm in order to compute and print out the cheapest cost from San Francisco (vertex 0) to each other city. 




We can represent this map as an adjacency matrix
